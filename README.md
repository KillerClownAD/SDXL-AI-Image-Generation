# Fooocus - SDXL Web Interface

Created an AI generated image through fooocus.

Iâ€™m sharing information about Fooocus, an image generation platform designed specifically for SDXL, Fooocus aims to offer a simple interface for new users or those who prefer to focus on prompting rather than tweaking settings.

The system includes built-in optimizations, so users donâ€™t have to adjust settings themselves. Fooocus is a tool that allows anyone with basic computer skills and a gaming PC to create realistic AI-generated images for free, without any restrictions. While AI image generation isnâ€™t a new concept, the elimination of entry barriers means that itâ€™s now impossible to fully trust any image you encounter online. Iâ€™ve been experimenting with an unrestricted image-generating AI called hashtag#Fooocus. It runs locally on your GPU and requires some RAM. I just wish my PC had higher specs.

ðŸ‘‰ The basic interface features only a prompt field and a generate button. Using SDXL 1.0 + refiner (integrated into the system), it generates one 1024x1024 image in 16 seconds on an RTX 3070 with 8GB VRAM(as stated by users). We rendered on Macbook Pro M3 Pro (11-Core CPU and 14-Core GPU) and Macbook Air M3 (8-Core CPU and 8-Core GPU).

It gives several advanced options available through an expandable menu, activated by checking the Advanced box. These options include preset sizes for images, speed and quality settings, image number, random seed, and an optional negative prompt. The Style Option tab offers nearly 50 different styles that can be applied to prompts, with Fooocus embedding the style keywords automatically. This feature is fun to experiment with. Overall, Fooocus provides a perfect interface for demo purposes.

ðŸ‘‰ For more knowledge, SDXL, short for "Stable Diffusion XL," is a more advanced and larger version of the Stable Diffusion model, which is a type of text-to-image generative model. Developed by Stability AI, SDXL is designed to produce high-quality, detailed images from textual descriptions. Here are some key aspects of SDXL: -
1. Model Architecture: SDXL uses a diffusion-based architecture, where the model iteratively refines a noise-perturbed image to match the given text description. 
2. Image Quality: Due to its larger size and improved architecture, SDXL can generate images with higher resolution and more intricate details. This makes it suitable for applications requiring high-quality visuals.

Produced with Fooocus AI:- First Image: - Cyberpunk City, Squirrel, Realistic, City should be in Background. Second Image: - Realistic Portrait of Russian Woman with Blonde Hair, No Make Up, influencer.

First Image was rendered on Macbook Pro M3 Pro took 10 Minutes and Second Image was rendered on Macbook Air M3 took 80 Minutes.
